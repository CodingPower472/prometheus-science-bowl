## Why did we build this?
When we decided to run a tournament, we were tired of the slow and manual process that usually constitutes Science Bowl tournaments. Often, running a tournament consists of manually setting permissions for every team, every round. Usually, something goes wrong and the tournament gets delayed by half an hour.

We knew there had to be a better way, so we built it. With our system, we were able to run our tournament rounds up to twice as quickly as most other tournaments.

## What's our solution?
We built a complete system to run a tournament, with features including:
- A moderator interface with scoring, time management, and question-displaying
- Automatic match and bracket making, integrating with Google Sheets
- A latency-corrected buzzer system
- A system team creation and player sign-in system using just a Google account
- A proprietary system to make moderator overreads *impossible*
