# Prometheus Science Bowl

## Why did we build this?
When we decided to run a tournament, we were tired of the slow and manual process that usually constitutes Science Bowl tournaments. Often, running a tournament consists of manually setting permissions for every team, every round. Usually, something goes wrong and the tournament gets delayed by half an hour.

## What's our solution?
We built an all-in-one system, with features including:
- A moderator interface with scoring, time management, and question-displaying
- Automatic match and bracket making, integrating with Google Sheets
- A system team creation and player sign-in system using just a Google account
and, finally..
- Our proprietary system to make moderator overreads **impossible!**
